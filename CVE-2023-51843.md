Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Attack Type:
Remote

Impact:
Information Disclosure

Severityï¼š
High

Description:
react-dashboard 1.4.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) as httpOnly is not set.
1. Setting "httpOnly" to false may be due to specific design needs or use cases. In some cases, applications may need to access cookie data via JavaScript to implement specific functionality or to interact with other components. However, to be clear, setting "httpOnly" to false may increase potential security risks. Allowing client-side JavaScript to access cookies containing sensitive data can lead to security issues such as XSS attacks. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to steal a user's credentials or perform malicious actions.

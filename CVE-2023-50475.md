Affected Version:
bcoin v2.2.0

Vendor:
bcoin-org
https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin

Software:
https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin

Vulnerability File:
https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin/blob/master/node_modules/bsock/vendor/faye-websocket.js
1. bcoin-master\node_modules\bsock\vendor\faye-websocket.js, line 1462
2. bcoin-master\node_modules\bsock\vendor\faye-websocket.js, line 2919

Attack Type:
CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

Impact:
Information Disclosure

Severityï¼š
Hign

Description:
using insecure hash algorithms

The current implementation in the code utilizes the MD5 and SHA1 hash algorithm, which is considered weak and vulnerable to attacks such as collision and preimage attacks. This poses a security risk as it can potentially be exploited by malicious actors to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the WebSocket communication.
In practical applications, SHA-256 and more secure hashing algorithms should be used first.

Description:
DeviceFarmer stf v3.6.6 suffers from Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
This algorithm is known to have significant vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. DES-ECB uses a fixed encryption key and does not incorporate an initialization vector (IV). As a result, it produces the same output for identical input blocks, making it susceptible to pattern recognition and exposing encrypted data patterns.

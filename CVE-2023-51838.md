Description:
Ylianst MeshCentral 1.1.16 suffers from Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
Use an insecure HMAC algorithm: HMAC-MD5, which is widely considered to be a less secure algorithm and is not recommended for continued use in a secure environment because it is susceptible to exhaustive searches and brute force attacks. Therefore, in practical applications, more secure algorithms such as HMAC-SHA1 should be used first.

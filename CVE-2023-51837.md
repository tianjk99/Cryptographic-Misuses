Description:
Ylianst MeshCentral 1.1.16 is vulnerable to Missing SSL Certificate Validation.
1. In the application's network request, the rejectUnauthorized attribute is set to false. This property is used to verify the server's certificate in HTTPS connections. Setting rejectUnauthorized to false can cause applications to bypass certificate↳
2. Use insecure TLS versions (such as SSLv3, TLSv1.0, and TLSv1.1) in your application. These TLS versions have known security vulnerabilities and weaknesses, exposing applications to potential security risks.
